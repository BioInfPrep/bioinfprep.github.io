We kindly ask you to prepare your computer by installing the software required in the course beforehand. This saves everyone a lot of time at the beginning since some of the installation procedures can take a couple of minutes. In case something doesn't work out as expected during the software installation, we can still sort things out on-site at the beginning of the course!  

## Linux

For this part you need a Linux operating system and there are a couple of options 
for either already having one or getting one:

- If you are using a Linux operating system, you're prepared!

- If you have macOS as an operating system (true, if you have some MacBook) you're prepared!

- If you have Microsoft Windows as an operating system, you will need to set up a Linux environment, the so-called *Windows Subsystem for Linux* (WSL):

  - Windows 10 or 11: 
    - [Instructions](https://www.windowscentral.com/how-install-wsl2-windows-10)  
  - Other Windows version:
    - You need to install Virtual Box and within it a Linux operating system
    - [Instructions](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/how-to-run-ubuntu-desktop-on-a-virtual-machine-using-virtualbox) for installing Virtual Box and an Ubuntu Linux VM


## LaTeX

For typesetting with LaTeX we will use an online service called [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/).  
Todo: Please create an account.

## Git

Please install Git on your computer. To do so, follow the [installation
instructions](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) in
the official Git Book.

Additionally, please create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com) if you don't have one already.

## Python

#### Miniconda (to be installed) 
We will work with a modern solution to work with the Python programming language, wich is called Miniconda. Even if you already have another Python installation we strongly recommend to install Miniconda. One of the cool features of Miniconda is that it is a self-contained Python installation without interfering with other Python installations on your computer.

- [Download links](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) (Depends in your operating system)
- [Installation instructions](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) (Depends in your operating system)

#### PyCharm (to be installed) 
PyCharm is a so-called *Integrated Development Environment* (IDE), which is specialised 
for working with the Python programming language. Basically, an IDE is a text editor
to write your programs (the so-called source code), which has many special features
that make your life easier when working with a programming language.
There is a free (community) edition that you can use. If you already have a university email address you can also obtain a professional edition for free.

- Community edition [download link](https://www.jetbrains.com/de-de/pycharm/download/) (Depends in your operating system)
- For the free professional license have a look [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students).
