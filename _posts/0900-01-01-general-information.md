The *Bioinformatics Preparatory Course* is a pre-semester course for students
that are about to start the Master's program in *Bioinformatics* or *Medical
Informatics*. The course typically covers the following topics:

- An introduction to operating Unix / Linux computer systems
- An introduction to version control using Git
- An introduction to typesetting with LaTeX
- An introduction to programming in Python
- An introduction to programming in Java

The Bioinformatics Prep Course aims at introducing students to the basic
computational issues. It is not going to cover entire programming taught in the
Bachelor Bioinformatics course, rather it is meant to provide a starting point
for those who are planning a career in bioinformatics, but have no experience
with Linux-like systems and programming. It is a prep course, therefore no ECTS
points are awarded.

## COVID-19

Due to the practical nature of the course we are planning to hold the course
on-site in line with the University's regulations.  We will have to take
precautions in line with the [hygiene
concept](https://uni-tuebingen.de/universitaet/infos-zum-coronavirus/) of the
University and will keep you updated on the developments of the regulations.

You can <b>NOT</b> participate in the course if you had contact to an infected
person within the last 14 days or currently have contact to an infected person.
This includes working with patients without adequate protective measures (FFP2
mask, overall, gloves, protective glasses).<br/><br/>

You can <b>NOT</b> participate in the course if you have or had symptoms in the
last 48 hours such as fever, dry cough or partial or full loss of your sense of
taste or sense of smell.

A distance of at least 2m between all people in the room has to be kept. The
room in which the course will take place will be sufficiently large to ensure
that the required distance between all participants can be maintained during
the course.<br/><br/>

Please bring sufficiently warm clothing as the room will have to be aired frequently.

## Course Concept

The course is designed as a practical course, i.e. you can and are encouraged
to try everything that is discussed in the course right away. Tutors will be
available to support you in these practical tasks. Unfortunately, we do not
have a computer pool room available for the course. Therefore, ⚠️ **please bring your own laptop to the course** ⚠️.

To save time during the course, we ask all participants to prepare
their computers by following the [Installation Instructions](/help/install-instructions.html) for software
that is going to be used in the course. Do not hesitate to contact us if you
have questions regarding the software installation.
