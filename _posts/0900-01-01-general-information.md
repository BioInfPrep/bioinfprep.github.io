The *Bioinformatics Preparatory Course* is a pre-semester course for students
that are about to start the Master's program in Bioinformatics or Medical
Informatics.

## <span style="color:orange">COVID-19</span>

<span style="color:orange">Currently, the course is planned to happen *on-site*. We will, however, have to
take precautions in line with the [hygiene
concept](https://uni-tuebingen.de/universitaet/infos-zum-coronavirus/) of the
University. We will keep you updated on the developments of the regulations.</span>

- <span style="color:orange">Please bring a face mask.</span>
- <span style="color:orange">Please bring warm cloths. We will have to air the room frequently.</span>

## General Concept

The course is designed as a practical course, i.e. you can and are encouraged
to try everything that is discussed in the course right away. Tutors will be
available to support you in these practical tasks. Unfortunately, we do not
have a computer pool room available for the course. Therefore, 

⚠️ **please bring your own laptop to the course**

and follow the [Installation Instructions]() for software that is going to be used in the course.

## Location

The course takes place at the *Sand Campus* of the University of Tübingen.

⚠️ **In October 2020, the course will take place in room F119 (Sand 6/7). You
can find the building to your left after you have entered the Sand campus
through the main gate.**

⚠️ **There will be a one hour lunch brake every day, but be aware that there is
no cafeteria at the Sand campus.**
