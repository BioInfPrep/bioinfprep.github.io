We kindly ask you to prepare your computer by installing the software necessary
to participate in the course beforehand. This saves everyone a lot of time at
the beginning of the course, since some of the installation procedures take a
couple of minutes. In case something doesn't work out as expected during the
software installation, we can still sort things out on-site at the beginning of
the course!

## Unix / Linux

For the first part of the course covering Unix / Linux, you will need a
Unix-like computer system to work with (who would have thought ðŸ™‚).

If you are using a laptop running any Linux distribution, you are good to go for the first day!

macOS is a Unix operating system, so if you're laptop is a MacBook (Air), you're also good to go for the first course day!

If you're laptop runs Microsoft Windows, you will need to set up a Linux
environment to work with during the first and potentially also during the
second course day. If you are running Windows 10, <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/install-windows-subsystem-linux-windows-10">installing the Windows
Subsystem for Linux (WSL)</a> may be the easiest option to go for. Otherwise, please follow the <a href="/help/vm-install.html">instructions for installing a Linux virtual machine</a>.

## Typesetting with LaTeX

In this segment of the course, we will be using an online service called
[Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/). Please create an account there in preparation for the course.

## Version control with Git

Please install Git on your computer. To do so, follow the [installation
instructions](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) in
the official Git Book.

Additionally, please create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com) if you don't have one already.

## Programming in Python

Please install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and the
[PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) Python IDE. There is a free
community edition, but with a University email address you can also obtain a
free professional edition
[here](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students).
