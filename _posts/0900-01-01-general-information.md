The *Bioinformatics Preparatory Course* is a pre-semester course for students
that are about to start the Master's program in *Bioinformatics* or *Medical
Informatics*. The course typically covers the following topics:

- An introduction to operating Unix / Linux computer systems
- An introduction to version control using Git
- An introduction to typesetting with LaTeX
- An introduction to programming in Python
- An introduction to programming in Java

*Note that the WS 2020-21 course will not contain the introduction to Java but
will offer additional Python training instead.*

The Bioinformatics Prep Course aims at introducing students to the basic
computational issues. It is not going to cover entire programming taught in the
Bachelor Bioinformatics course, rather it is meant to provide a starting point
for those who are planning a career in bioinformatics, but have no experience
with Linux-like systems and programming. It is a prep course, therefore no ECTS
points are awarded.

## COVID-19

Due to the practical nature of the course we are planning to hold the course
on-site in line with the University's regulations.  We will have to take
precautions in line with the [hygiene
concept](https://uni-tuebingen.de/universitaet/infos-zum-coronavirus/) of the
University. We will keep you updated on the developments of the regulations.

A distance of at least 2m between all people in the room has to be kept
(exceptions see below). The room in which the course will take place will be
sufficiently large to ensure that the required distance between all
participants can be maintained during the course.<br/><br/>

Please bring sufficiently warm clothing as the room will have to be aired frequently.

Face masks have to be work at all times unless when seated with the required distance to other people in the room.
During the course, the tutors will walk through the room to offer assistance
during practical tasks. When a tutor supports a participant at their computer
and the minimum distance cannot be maintained, both the tutor and the
participant have to wear a face mask.

## Course Concept

The course is designed as a practical course, i.e. you can and are encouraged
to try everything that is discussed in the course right away. Tutors will be
available to support you in these practical tasks. Unfortunately, we do not
have a computer pool room available for the course. Therefore, ⚠️ **please bring your own laptop to the course** ⚠️.

To save time during the course, we furthermore ask all participants to prepare
their computers by following the [Installation Instructions](/help/install-instructions.html) for software
that is going to be used in the course. Do not hesitate to contact us if you
have questions regarding the software installation.

## Location

can find the building to your left after you have entered the Sand campus
through the main gate.**

⚠️ **There will be a one hour lunch brake every day, but be aware that there is
no cafeteria at the Sand campus.**
